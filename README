mod_cloudflare for Apache

Copyright CloudFlare Inc. 2013

## mod_cloudflare.c ##

Based on mod_remoteip.c, this Apache extension will replace the remote_ip
variable in user's logs with the correct remote IP sent from CloudFlare. The
module only performs the IP substitution for requests originating from
CloudFlare IPs by default.

To install, either run apxs2 directly against the .c source file:

    $ apxs2 -a -i -c mod_cloudflare.c

An alternative way to install is to use GNU autotools, which requires that
autoconf and automake already be installed:

    $ autoconf
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

No further configuration is needed. However, if you wish to override the
default values, the following directives are exposed:

### CloudFlareRemoteIPHeader ###

This specifies the header which contains the original IP. Default:

    CloudFlareRemoteIPHeader CF-Connecting-IP

### CloudFlareRemoteIPTrustedProxy ###

This is the IP range from which we will allow the CloudFlareRemoteIPHeader to
be used from. See https://www.cloudflare.com/wiki/What_are_the_CloudFlare_IP_address_ranges
for a complete list.

Note that on some systems, you may have to add a LoadModule directive
manually. This should look like:

    LoadModule cloudflare_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_cloudflare.so

Replace /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_cloudflare.so with the path to
mod_cloudflare.so on your system.

If you cannot find apxs or apxs2, install apache2-dev on Debian and Ubuntu, or
httpd-devel on Red Hat and CentOS:

    $ apt-get install apache2-dev
    $ yum install httpd-devel

NOTES:

- If mod_cloudflare and mod_remoteip are enabled on the same web server, the
server will crash if they both try to set the remote IP to a different value.

- Enabling mod_cloudflare will not effect the performance of Apache in any
noticeable manner. AB testing both over LAN and WAN show no equivalent numbers
with and without mod_cloudflare.

- If you like, you may also add the directive DenyAllButCloudFlare. This will result 
in all requests from IPs which are not in the CloudFlareRemoteIPTrustedProxy range 
being denied with a status of 403.
